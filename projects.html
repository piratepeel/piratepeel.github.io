                    <br> Interactions among people or objects are often dynamic in nature and can be represented as a sequence of networks, each providing a snapshot of the interactions over a brief period of time. An important task in analyzing such evolving networks is change-point detection, in which we both identify the times at which the large-scale pattern of interactions changes fundamentally and quantify how large and what kind of change occurred. Here, we formalize for the first time the network change-point detection problem within an online probabilistic learning framework and introduce a method that can reliably solve it. This method combines a generalized hierarchical random graph model with a Bayesian hypothesis test to quantitatively determine if, when, and precisely how a change point has occurred. We analyze the detectability of our method using synthetic data with known change points of different types and magnitudes, and show that this method is more accurate than several previously used alternatives. Applied to two high-resolution evolving social networks, this method identifies a sequence of change points that align with known external "shocks" to these networks.

                <li><h3><a href="sportskills.html">Sports scoring dynamics</a></h3>
                    <br>Professional team sports provide an excellent domain for studying the dynamics of social competitions. These games are constructed with simple, well-defined rules and payoffs that admit a high-dimensional set of possible actions and nontrivial scoring dynamics. The resulting gameplay and efforts to predict its evolution are the object of great interest to both sports professionals and enthusiasts. In this paper, we consider two online prediction problems for team sports:~given a partially observed game Who will score next? and ultimately Who will win? We present novel interpretable generative models of within-game scoring that allow for dependence on lead size (restoration) and on the last team to score (anti-persistence). We then apply these models to comprehensive within-game scoring data for four sports leagues over a ten year period. By assessing these models' relative goodness-of-fit we shed new light on the underlying mechanisms driving the observed scoring dynamics of each sport. Furthermore, in both predictive tasks, the performance of our models consistently outperforms baselines models, and our models make quantitative assessments of the latent team skill, over time.
