<h2>Motivation and Goals</h2>
<p>Problems involving networks and massive network datasets motivate some of the most difficult and

exciting inferential challenges today, from social, economic, and biological domains. Modern network

data are often more than just vertices and edges, containing rich information on vertex attributes, 

edge weights, and characteristics that change over time. Enormous in size, detail, and heterogeneity, 

these networks are often best represented as highly annotated sequences of graphs. Although much 

progress has been made on developing rigorous tools for analyzing and modeling some types of large, 

complex, real-world networks, much work still remains, and a principled, coherent framework remains 

elusive, in part because network analysis is a young and highly cross-disciplinary field.

This workshop aims to bring together a diverse and cross-disciplinary set of researchers to discuss

recent advances and future directions for developing new network methods in statistics and machine 

learning. By network methods, we broadly include those models and algorithms whose goal is to 

learn the patterns of interaction, flow of information, or propagation of effects in social, biological, 

and informational systems. We also welcome empirical studies in applied domains such as the social 

sciences, biology, medicine, neuroscience, physics, finance, social media, and economics. And, we are 

particularly interested in research that unifies the study of both structure and content in rich network 

datasets.</p>

<p>While this research field is already broad and diverse, there are emerging signs of convergence, 

maturation, and increased methodological awareness. For example, in the study of information 

diffusion, social media and social network researchers are beginning to use rigorous tools to distinguish 

effects driven by social influence, homophily, or external processes -- subjects historically of intense 

interest amongst statisticians and social scientists. Similarly, there is a growing statistics literature 

developing learning approaches to study topics popularized earlier within the physics community, 

including clustering in graphs, network evolution, and random-graph models. Finally, learning methods 

are increasingly used in highly complex application domains, such as brain networks, and massive 

social networks like Facebook, and these applications are stimulating new scientific and practical 

questions that sometimes cut across disciplinary boundaries.</p>

 <h3>Overlapping community detection by spectral methods</h3>
<h4>Abstract:</h4>
Community detection is a fundamental problem in network analysis which is made more challenging by overlaps between communities which often occur in practice.   Here we propose a general, flexible, and interpretable generative model for overlapping communities, which can be thought of as a generalization of the degree-corrected stochastic block model.   We develop an efficient spectral algorithm for estimating the community memberships, which deals with the overlaps by employing the K-medians algorithm rather than the usual K-means for clustering in the spectral domain.  We show that the algorithm is asymptotically consistent when networks are not too sparse and the overlaps between communities not too large.   Numerical experiments on both simulated networks and many real social networks demonstrate that our method performs very well compared to a number of benchmark methods for overlapping community detection.    This is joint work with Yuan Zhang and Ji Zhu.

<h3>Organization of communities in graphs</h3>
<h4>Abstract:</h4>
The study of such networks seeks to find common structural patterns and explain their emergence through tractable models of network formation. We will discuss machine learning techniques for modeling networks at the level of groups of nodes. Such models can be used to summarize the network structure, identify network communities, predict links between the nodes, and estimate missing features or types of nodes.

<h3><a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~moore/">Cris Moore</a> (Santa Fe Institute)</h3>
<h3>Physics-inspired Algorithms and Phase Transitions in Community Detection</h3>
<h4>Abstract:</h4>Detecting communities, and labeling nodes, is a ubiquitous problem in the study of networks.  Recently, we developed scalable Belief Propagation algorithms that update probability distributions of node labels until they reach a fixed point.  In addition to being of practical use, these algorithms can be studied analytically, revealing phase transitions in the ability of any algorithm to solve this problem.  Specifically, there is a detectability transition in sparse networks, below which no algorithm can label nodes better than chance.

I'll explain this transition, and give an accessible introduction to Belief Propagation and the analogy with free energy and the cavity method of statistical physics.  We'll see that the consensus of many good solutions is a better labeling than the "best" solution --- something that is true for many real-world optimization problems.  While many algorithms overfit, and find "communities" even in random graphs where none exist, our method lets us focus on statistically-significant communities.  

If time permits, I'll also explain some connections between Belief Propagation and a new spectral algorithm, based on the non-backtracking matrix, which succeeds all the way down to the detectability transition.

This is joint work with Aurelien Decelle, Florent Krzakala, Elchanan Mossel, Joe Neeman, Mark Newman, Allan Sly, Lenka Zdeborova, and Pan Zhang.

<h3>The Strange Paths that Information takes</h3>
<h4>Abstract:</h4>
A primary function of online social networks is to share information, and it is in online social networks, and in particular on Facebook, where we can start to trace the paths the information takes across social ties, uncovering several interesting characteristics. To some extent, the reach, if not the exact path of the information, is predictable. One can make the prediction based on the content, the initiator, and the early diffusion structure and timing. Some content will be primarily broadcast, while certain types will make many steps, being passed from person to person to person. A category of information that is propagated through multiple steps is that of rumors. The spread will depend on the rumor's veracity, as will the likelihood that their telling will be retracted. Even more curiously, rumors can experience a resurgence in popularity from near dormancy. These peaks may correspond to the same exact rumor, or very likely they will contain one or more alterations. In fact, by studying information that has been copied from one status update to another we find frequent mutations, in a process akin to biological evolution. These and other interesting aspects of information diffusion in networks will be discussed in the talk.

Lada Adamic leads the Product Science group within Facebook's Data Science Team. She is also an adjunct associate professor at the University of Michigan's School of Information and Center for the Study of Complex Systems. Her research interests center on information dynamics in networks: how information diffuses, how it can be found, and how it influences the evolution of a network's structure. Her projects have included identifying expertise in online question and answer forums, studying the dynamics of viral marketing, and characterizing the structural and communication patterns in online social media. She has received an NSF CAREER award, a University of Michigan Henry Russell award, the 2012 Lagrange Prize in Complex Systems.
